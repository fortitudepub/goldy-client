To contribute, please submit a Pull Request. The only thing that we ask that you do
is a very simple step, include a line modeled after this line:
        â€œDCO 1.1 Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.org&gt;"
as part of your pull request comments. By doing this one simple thing you are telling
the community that you wrote the code you are contributing or have the right to pass
on the code that you are contributing. The
DCO 1.1 referenced is the Developer Certificate of Origin that is used in the Linux Kernel community, you can find it [here](http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin "DCO 1.1").

Thank you!
